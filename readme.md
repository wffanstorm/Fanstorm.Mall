## Fanstorm.Mall

This repo is just for Learning use, under MIT licence. If you think it's good you can use this freely, but pls don't forget to give me a star :) . Thanks.

This repo contains the following projects:

### 1. Fanstorm.Mall.Server

This is a server side project use .Net 5, EF , with JWT Authentication.

### 2. Fanstorm_Mall_APP

This is a mobile side project use React Native 0.65.1.

Why the name style is different from the server side project ? Because when I went to init the RN project, it did't allow me use the name 'Fanstorm.Mall.APP' . So I use '_' instead.
